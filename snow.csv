Abstract
"Vahca is new snow. Vahca causes bad travel conditions. but makes it easy to see where the reindeer have gone (track). Vahca can soften hard snow. The reindeer feel free to walk in different directions under such conditions."
"Čearga is created by strong winds which have blown the snow and rolled it to become hard. Čearga is so hard that neither reindeer nor herders can dig through it. Where čearga occurs. grazing is prevented and reindeer are “locked out” of the pasture. Čearga can have a thickness of one meter."
"In the winter. when it has been cold for a while. then the seaŋáš process (seaŋkut) starts. Refrigeration promotes this process. In spring. the wind can change the snow to seaŋáš. The snow is grainier and is not stuck to the ground. It is easy to move it and the reindeer can easily dig through seaŋáš to access food."
"Sievlla is very wet snow which occurs when the weather has been mild and the snow has begun to thaw completely through. The snow is wet and it is hard to walk on because a person or animal will sink completely through the snow to the ground."
"Soavli is a mix of snow and water in which the snow melts from the bottom of the snow upwards. It is important to be careful when traveling in soavli. because the snow can be deep on the upper side of soavli. but soft and wet at the very base."
"Bihci (ground surface frost) occurs when the ground is snow-free and cold. The cold conditions form bihci on the surface of the ground. The use of the concept Bihci is entirely associated with conditions on the ground."
"Ritni (frost on trees) is primarily formed on trees from warm moist air interacting with very cold snow surfaces. Specific weather conditions lead to the formation of ritni. Ritni sometimes occurs when there are is bare ground. but the snow must have been deposited before the warmer air arrives. If it has been cold for a long period of time. then “ritni” wood will occur and then it becomes difficult to see anything at all."
"Njahcu is wet snow which occurs as a result of alternating snows and thaws. This prevents reindeer from grazing. Should there be njáhcu in occurring in connection with All Saints Day. it will become a bad winter because subsequent rain and warmer. then colder temperatures will form geardni (ice) and produce bodneskárta conditions."
"Geardni is a thin ice layer on the top surface of the snowpack. It occurs when it rains on the snowpack and then the rain freezes. The snow surface first becomes wet then frozen resulting in a thin ice layer on the top of the snow."
"Gaskageardni is a condition in which one or more hard ice layers within the snow pack which occurs when it snows on top of a geardni ice layer. If the ice layer in the middle is not softened. but is still hard. it will limit the reindeers' ability to dig through the ice to access their forage. There may be several layers within the snowpack."
"Bodneskarta is a condition that occurs in the fall when the early snow first melts across the ground and plants. then that water freezes. forming a hard coating of ice. The reindeer are not easily able to break through this layer to reach their food and this leads to a rudneguohtun winter."
"Moarri is a condition in which a crust is formed on the surface of the snow as a result of alternative thawing and refreezing of the top layers. The crust is not quite hard enough to support the weight of people or reindeer and will cut the feet when one breaks through. The reindeer avoid going into moarri and will wait until it becomes cuoŋu. If you are trying to move the herd. it becomes very difficult to do so because it is hard for the reindeer to move through this type of snowpack. Moarri is almost hard enough to support the weight of the reindeer. but breaks once they step on to it."
"Skáva is the formation of an ice layer or snow crust from sun melt at the surface of the snowpack during the day. followed quickly by cooling later in the evening. Skáva conditions are usually followed by cuoŋu conditions within the same day."
"Cuoŋu snow conditions are different forms of melting snow which develop when the weather is very warm. sunny. and mild then followed by rain. The snow then becomes sievlla (and on the lakes it becomes soavli). But subsequently. when it becomes very cold and that snow freezes. it will be almost like ice. Then. it is good traveling conditions for the reindeer. But difficult traveling conditions for the herders. In the forest areas. cuoŋu develops first under these conditions.."
""Two types of oppas (untouched snow) are:"
"1) One type of oppas describes an area where there has not been re-feeding. The snow is soft and it is easy for the reindeer dig through the snow pack to reach the food at the bottom of the snowpack. These conditions enable the herd to move in pastures for feeding. 2) Another type of oppas is characterized by very deep snow which makes it difficult to travel because it is necessary to wade."
"This is a verb which describes the process by which Seaŋáš changes the snow so that it becomes more porous. and both bodneskárta and geardni disappear."
"Čiegar is hard snow which has been heavily trampled by reindeer and. thus. compressed into snow so hard that the reindeer are not able to dig through it to access the plants and the herders should avoid these areas. Sometimes the čiegar conditions can change to a more favorable snow state for grazing. and if it is an area rich in lichens. then the reindeer can be allowed to graze there. In the very rare cases where an area with small amounts of snow develops into čiegar conditions and the lichens are abundant. it is possible to let the reindeer graze this area before Christmas. but not throughout the winter. Reindeer cannot be returned repeatedly to these thinner snow areas to graze because the bottom of this snowpack will be frozen too hard to permit access to food."
"Bearta is an intermediate condition which involves both bare ground and/or snowpack. which occurs in the fall after it has been snowing but when the weather has become milder again. The snow and ground become like ice – rough and hard. In some areas. it is bare ground; and in others. snow. It is difficult to see tracks and it is difficult to travel. The reindeer tend to walk a lot when it is bearta."
